                Xanthos was an ancient major city near present-day Kınık,
                Antalya Province, Turkey. The remains of Xanthos lie on a hill
                on the left bank of the Xanthos river. The number and quality of
                the monumental tombs still standing is a remarkable feature of
                the site. Xanthos is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Xanthos was a
                centre of culture and commerce for the Lycians, and later for
                the Persians, Greeks and Romans who in turn conquered the city.
                Made up of two neighboring settlements located in the
                southwestern part of Anatolia, respectively within the
                boundaries of Antalya and Muğla Provinces, Xanthos-Letoon is a
                remarkable archaeological complex. As an important city in
                Lycia, it exerted significant architectural influences upon
                other cities of the region, with the Nereid Monument directly
                inspiring the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus in Caria. It represents
                the most unique extant architectural example of the ancient
                Lycian Civilization, which was one of the most important
                cultures of the Iron Age in Anatolia.

                Trojan War heroes and Lycian leaders Glaucus and Sarpedon,
                founder of Xanthos, are described in the Iliad as allies of the
                Trojans. In the same text, Achilles' immortal, talking horse is
                named Xanthos. The acropolis of Xanthos dates from the 8th c.
                BC. The city is mentioned by numerous ancient Greek and Roman
                writers and Strabo notes Xanthos as the largest city in Lycia.
                The important religious sanctuary of Leto at Letoon, 4 km south
                of Xanthos, dates from the late 6th century BC and was closely
                associated with the city and linked by a sacred road.

                Xanthos, which was the capital of ancient Lycia, illustrates the
                blending of Lycian traditions with the Hellenic influence,
                especially in its funerary art. The rock-cut tombs, pillar tombs
                and pillar-mounted sarcophagi in Xanthos are unique examples of
                ancient funerary architecture.The rock-cut tombs, pillar tombs

                recognized in Antiquity and they influenced the art of
                neighboring provinces: the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus is for
                instance directly influenced by the Xanthos Nereid Monument.

                Letoon, on the other hand, was the cult center of Xanthos, the
                ancient federal sanctuary of the Lycian province and Lycian
                League of Cities. As many inscriptions found at the site
                demonstrate, the federal sanctuary was the place where all
                religious and political decisions of the ruling powers were
                declared to the public.

                Xanthos has been a mecca for students of Anatolian civilisation
                since the early 19th century. Of the monumental tombs, three,
                the Nereid Monument the Tomb of Payava and the sculptures of the
                Harpy tomb, are now exhibited in the British Museum on account
                of their splendid sculptural decoration and architecture. The
                Harpy Tomb, of equal merit but less well preserved, is still
                located in Xanthos with replica reliefs. The archeological
                excavations and surface investigations at Xanthos have yielded
                many texts in Lycian and Greek, including bilingual texts that
                are useful in the understanding of Lycian. The Xanthian Obelisk
                and the Letoon trilingual are two trilingual stelae which were
                found in the city and Letoon and record an older Anatolian
                language conventionally called Milyan language.

                Xanthos-Letoon has retained the authenticity of its features,
                largely due to the property’s distance from any modern
                settlement. The monuments revealed during archaeological
                excavations have gone through important restoration and
                conservations works, which have not impacted their authenticity
                in terms of design and layout. The most important project was
                the reconstruction of the temple of Leto in its original setting
                between 2000 and 2007. The architectural pieces that belonged to
                the temple of Leto, which were found during excavations carried
                out since 1950s, enabled the successful completion of this
                project. Some important restoration, conservation and
                consolidation works were also carried out on the Early Christian
                Church and monumental nymphaeum.

                Today the site of Xanthos overlooks the modern Turkish village
                of Kınık. Once over 500 m long, the Roman Kemer Bridge crossed
                the upper reaches of the river near the present-day village of
                Kemer. The modern Turkish name of the river is Eşen Çayı.
