                Sardis was an ancient city at the location of modern Sart , near
                Salihli, in Turkey's Manisa Province.Sardis was the capital of
                the ancient kingdom of Lydia,one of the important cities of the
                Persian Empire, the seat of a Seleucid Satrap, the seat of a
                proconsul under the Roman Empire, and the metropolis of the
                province Lydia in later Roman and Byzantine times.Its importance
                was due first to its military strength, secondly to its
                situation on an important highway leading from the interior to
                the Aegean coast, and thirdly to its commanding the wide and
                fertile plain of the Hermus(Gediz river).

                As the capital city of the Lydians, a native Iron Age Anatolian
                people, Sardis came to rule an empire that encompassed most of
                western Anatolia in the seventh and sixth centuries BC. Lydian
                Sardis was conquered by the Persians in 547 BC, and became the
                seat of one of the most important satrapies of the Achaemenid
                Empire. Alexander the Great captured the city in 330 BC.

                Sardis occupied a strategic location and drew on the fertile
                agricultural land of the plain, the timber and mineral resources
                of the mountains, the natural defenses of its impregnable
                citadel, fresh water from streams, springs, and lakes, trade
                from the coast to the interior, and gold from some of the
                richest sources in antiquity.and although he “restored their
                former customs,” the Lydian and Persian royal capital was
                gradually converted to a Greek polis, with Greek institutions
                such as the council house, theater, gymnasium, and the famous
                temple of Artemis, the fourth largest Ionic temple in the
                ancient world. Under Roman rule, Sardis continued to flourish,
                although it never gained the stature it had had under the
                Lydians.

                Disaster came to the great city under the reign of the emperor
                Tiberius, when in 17 AD, Sardis was destroyed by an earthquake,
                but it was rebuilt with the help of ten million sesterces from
                the Emperor and exempted from paying taxes for five years. It
                was one of the great cities of western Asia Minor until the
                later Byzantine period.After 1071, the Hermus valley began to
                suffer from the inroads of the Seljuk Turks but the Byzantine
                general John Doukas reconquered the city in 1097.However once
                the Byzantines retook Constantinople in 1261, Sardis with the
                entire Asia Minor was neglected and the region eventually fell
                under the control of Ghazi emirs.

                Sardis holds a unique place in the history of Greece and the
                Near East. As tradesmen, patrons and conquerors, the Lydians
                played a vital role in the cultural interchanges between Greece
                and the great civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Near East.
                The Greeks came to see this familiar yet foreign culture as the
                prototypical “other:” wealthy, generous, economically and
                militarily dominant, but also ostentatious, vain, and sexually
                perverse; and they developed their own independent western
                identity in part as distinct from such Oriental absolutists

                Since 1958, both Harvard and Cornell Universities have sponsored
                annual archeological expeditions to Sardis. These excavations
                unearthed perhaps the most impressive synagogue in the western
                diaspora yet discovered from antiquity.The synagogue was a
                section of a large bath-gymnasium complex, that was in use for
                about 450–500 years. In the late 4th or 5th century, part of the
                bath-gymnasium complex was changed into a synagogue.
