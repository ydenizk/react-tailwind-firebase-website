                Laodicea was an ancient city in Asia Minor, now Turkey, on the
                river Lycus (Çürüksu). It was located in the Hellenistic regions
                of Caria and Lydia, which later became the Roman Province of
                Phrygia Pacatiana. It is now situated near the modern city of
                Denizli. In 2013 the archaeological site was inscribed in the
                Tentative List of World Heritage Sites in Turkey.It lay on a
                major trade route and in its neighbourhood were many important
                ancient cities; it was 17 km west of Colossae, 10 km south of
                Hierapolis and 160 km east of Ephesus. One of the major bonuses
                of rambling through the ruins here is the lack of crowds.Unlike
                Ephesus or Pamukkale's Hierapolis, Laodikeia is much less known,
                so a visit here makes for a very tranquil sightseeing
                experience.

              <p className="tracking-wider font-light  font-roboto  text-lg mb-6 leading-7">
                The town was originally called Diospolis, "City of Zeus", and
                afterwards Rhodas. Excavations in the northern necropolis have
                shown that the settlement existed before the Hellenistic
                foundation and was inhabited by the native population.During the
                Roman period Laodicea was the chief city of a Roman conventus,
                which comprised 24 cities besides itself; Cicero records holding
                assizes there ca. 50 BC.Strabo (64 BC - 24 AD) attributes the
                celebrity of the city to the fertility of the soil and the
                wealth of some of its inhabitants, amongst whom may have been
                Hiero of Laodicea, who adorned the city with many beautiful
                buildings and bequeathed to it more than 2000 talents at his
                death.

              <p className="tracking-wider font-light  font-roboto  text-lg mb-6 leading-7">
                The wealth of its inhabitants engendered a taste for the arts of
                the Greeks, as is manifest from its ruins, and that it
                contributed to the advancement of science and literature is
                attested by the names of the sceptics Antiochus and Theiodas,
                the successors of Aenesidemus (1st century BC), and by the
                existence of a great medical school.The area often suffered from
                earthquakes, especially from the great shock that occurred in
                the reign of Nero (60 AD) in which the town was completely
                destroyed. But the inhabitants declined imperial assistance to
                rebuild the city and restored it from their own means.With its
                large Jewish community, Laodicea very early became a seat of
                Christianity and a bishopric.

                The existing remains attest to its former greatness. Its many
                buildings include a stadium, baths, temples, a gymnasium, two
                theatres and a bouleuterion (Senate House). On the eastern side,
                the line of the ancient wall may be distinctly traced, with the
                remains of the Ephesus gate; there are streets traversing the
                town, flanked by colonnades and numerous pedestals. North of the
                town, towards the Lycus, are many sarcophagi, with their covers
                lying near them, partly embedded in the ground, and all having
                been long since rifled. The West theatre has been recently
                restored (2022) with virtually complete banks of stone
                seats.[36] Originally built in the Hellenistic period, it held
                8000 spectators and was used until the 7th c. AD.

                The stadium near the southern extremity of the city is in a good
                state of preservation. The seats are arranged along two sides of
                a narrow valley, which was taken advantage of for this purpose,
                and was closed up at both ends. Towards the west are
                considerable remains of a subterranean passage, by which
                chariots and horses were admitted into the arena, with a long
                inscription over the entrance.
