                Kaunos was a city of ancient Caria and in Anatolia, a few
                kilometres west of the modern town of Dalyan, Muğla Province,
                Turkey.The Calbys river (now known as the Dalyan river) was the
                border between Caria and Lycia. Initially Kaunos was a separate
                state; then it became a part of Caria and later still of Lycia.
                Kaunos was an important sea port, the history of which is
                supposed to date back to the 10th century BC. Because of the
                formation of İztuzu Beach and the silting of the former Bay of
                Dalyan (from approx. 200 BC onwards), Kaunos is now located
                about 8 km from the coast.After the capture of Caria by Turkish
                tribes, and the serious malaria epidemic of the 15th century AD,
                Kaunos was completely abandoned.

                Kaunos was an important sea port city with two ports; one is in
                the south at the southeast of Küçük Kale (Small Castle) and the
                inner port at its northwest, the present Sülüklü Göl (the Lake
                of the Leeches). The southern port was used from the foundation
                of the city till roughly the end of the Hellenistic era, after
                which it became inaccessible due to its drying out. The latter
                was used till the late days of Kaunos, but due to the silting of
                the delta and the ports, Kaunos had by then lost its important
                function as a trade port and started becoming poor.

                According to mythology Kaunos was founded by King Kaunos, son of
                the Carian King Miletus and Kyane, and grandson of Apollo.Life
                style and language of Kaunos people share similarities with
                Carian people. The existence of Kaunos had known by the scholars
                but its location was a mystery until English archaeologist
                Hoskyn discovered it in 1842. Swedish archaeologist P. Roos
                defined the independent state boundaries of Kaunos.

                Kaunos is a site that is interesting for both its archeological
                and ecological importance. Situated in the Köyceğiz-Dalyan
                Special Environmental Protection Area, it offers outstanding
                vistas and is rich in wildlife. The ruins of the city are near
                Dalyan, on the west bank of the ancient Kalbis river. The city
                was constructed on terraces; significant religious structures
                like Baselius Kaunios Temple, Apollon Sanctuary and Demeter
                Sacred Rocks on one side and Bath, Theatre and other structures
                including Palaestra on a large terrace which is called Upper

                and a domed Byzantine basilica Archaeological research has shown
                that the palaestra was built over part of the old city that most
                probably had been a place of worship. The Roman baths served as
                a social meeting place and were meant to impress the Kaunians —
                by their sheer dimensions — of the power of the Roman Empire.

                The port agora is located at the flat area in front of Sülüklü
                Lake.It dates back to the 4th century BC and kept its function
                as an economic, political and social meeting place until the end
                of the Roman era. The remains of pedestals indicate that there
                must have been many (bronze) statues of influential Romans, but
                these have not been found. Most likely these were melted down in
                the Byzantine era.The spectacular Kaunos city walls were erected
                during the reign of Mausolos in the 4th century BC. They are
                extraproportional in relation to the size of Kaunos and its
                population, presumably because the satrap had high expectations
                of the city's future as a marine and commercial port
