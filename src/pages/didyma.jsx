                Didyma was an ancient Greek sanctuary on the coast of Ionia in
                the domain of the famous city of Miletus.The ruins of Didyma are
                located a short distance to the northwest of modern Didim in
                Aydin Province, Turkey, whose name is derived from the ruins.
                Apollo was the main deity of the sanctuary of Didyma, also
                called Didymaion. But it was home to both of the temples
                dedicated to the twins Apollo and Artemis.The Temple of Apollo
                at Didyma was the fourth largest temple in the ancient Greek
                world.The Didymaion was well renowned in antiquity because of
                its famed oracle.

                The Didymaion, the temple of Apollo and its oracle at Didyma,
                had a considerable reputation in the ancient times. The temple's
                oracle, second in importance only to that at Delphi, played a
                significant role in the religious and political life of both
                Miletus and the greater Mediterranean world; many rulers, from
                Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE) to the Roman emperor
                Diocletian (244-313 CE) visited or sent delegations to this
                oracle seeking the guidance and favor of Apollo
              </p>
              <p className="tracking-wider font-light  font-roboto  text-lg mb-6 leading-7">
                The linear distance between Miletus and Didyma measures some 16
                km. As well as the simple footway there also existed a Sacred
                Way between the city and its sanctuary which measured some 20 km
                in distance. This Sacred Way, built in the 6th century BC, was
                used for festival processions.The annual festival held in Didyma
                under the auspices of Miletus were called the Didymeia.

                In a world where “church and state” were inseparable, the Temple
                of Apollo at Didyma played a critical role in the religious and
                political life of ancient Miletus. The temple complex served as
                the site of important religious festivals, sacrifices, and
                votive offerings while the oracle exercised a significant
                influence on Milesian civic statutes, treaties, public
                enterprises, and was relied upon to provide protection against
                enemies and to help direct public and foreign affairs.The
                importance of the site meant that the office of the high priest
                (not to be confused with the oracle), whose job it was to
                preside over the sanctuary, was an immensely powerful and highly
                sought after position.his office was so prestigious and the
                sanctuary so crucial to the religious and political affairs of
                Miletus and the larger Mediterranean that numerous Roman
                emperors, including Trajan, Hadrian and Julian, were “elected”
                to this position.Both Julius Caesar and Caligula served as
                patrons of the sanctuary.

                Medusa is one of the most important symbols of Didyma which is
                exhibited at the entrance of the Temple of Apollo. According to
                the belief, Medusa, a beautiful young girl in her youth, was
                turned into a terrible gorgon girl with snake hair who turn
                people into stones by jealous gods. Medusa, a mortal under
                ground female monster, is beheaded and killed at Athena’s
                request. Medusa figures were used in ancient times to protect
                large buildings and private places such as temples from evil, as
                well as to make people to think again before they do evil
                things.

                The Hellenistic temple had two predecessors. The first sacred
                building dedicated to Apollo was erected around 700 BC.The
                oldest temple of Apollo surrounded the sacred spring and the
                sacred laurel tree. This spring and tree formed the centre of
                the sanctuary for more than 1000 years.Ionic columns were partly
                ornamented with reliefs like the columns of the temple of
                Artemis in Ephesus.Although the construction work continued for
                over 600 years the temple of Apollo was never completed. But the
                main body of the temple itself had been completed around 100 BC.
                In the following centuries Miletus continued to erect the
                columns of the colonnade.The Temple of Apollo was a major
                monument is it's day, however now not much of it's sanctuary can
                be seen. What can be seen is a collasal, unfinished Ionic
                temple.

              <p className="tracking-wider font-light  font-roboto  text-lg mb-6 leading-7">
                The foundations of the temple of Artemis were discovered in 2013
                directly behind the mosque and former Greek Orthodox church of
                Saint Charalambos 100 m north of the temple of Apollo. In
                contrast to the temple of Apollo the foundation of the temple of
                Artemis is orientated exactly East-West, as it is common for
                most Greek temples.After the excavations the foundations were
                reinterred after each campaign, so today nothing is visible of
                them. It is not altogether clear if the temple of Artemis was
                orientated to the east or to the west because its altar has not
                yet been found. During excavations at the east side came no
                remains of the altar to light, and the area in front of the west
                side has not yet been excavated.
