                Knidos or Cnidus was a Greek city in ancient Caria and part of
                the Dorian Hexapolis, in south-western Anatolia(Asia Minor).It
                was situated on the Datça peninsula.Founded by Greek settlers,
                Knidos was an important cultural and political centre by the 5th
                century BC and, with its large natural harbours, the city was
                also an ancient trading hub. Throughout this period, Knidos was
                a member of the Dorian Hexapolis – a federation of six cities of
                Dorian Greek origin – along with Halicarnassus and Kos among
                others.
              </p>
              <p className="tracking-wider font-light  font-roboto  text-lg mb-6 leading-7">
                The extreme length of the city was little less than a mile, and
                the whole intramural area is still thickly strewn with
                architectural remains.The walls, both of the island and on the
                mainland, can be traced throughout their whole circuit; and in
                many places, especially round the acropolis, at the northeast
                corner of the city, they are remarkably perfect.During the
                hellenistic age, Knidos boasted a medical school; however, the
                theory that this school already existed at the beginning of the
                classical age is an unwarranted extrapolation. In their
                expansion into the region, the Romans easily obtained the
                allegiance of Knidians, and rewarded them for help given against
                Antiochus III the Great by leaving them the freedom of their
                city.

                The city was famed for its association with Aphrodite and for
                its famous statue of the goddess, sculpted by the renowned
                classical sculptor Praxiteles of Athens. While this statue has
                not survived, a number of copies exist, one of which can be
                found in the Vatican Museums.At Knidos itself, the ornate marble
                pedestal that the Aphrodite statue stood upon can still be seen.
                Also the Knidos Lion is now displayed under the roof of the
                Great Court in the British Museum.

              <p className="tracking-wider font-light  font-roboto  text-lg mb-6 leading-7">
                There is some debate about the age of the sculpture, in general,
                scholarly opinion dates it to the 2nd century BC. Since 2000, it
                has been prominently displayed on a plinth under the roof of the
                Queen Elizabeth II Great Court because soon after it was seen by
                British archaeologists in 1858, the statue was taken by the
                British to London where it became part of the British Museum's
                collection.The lion is substantially complete; only the lower
                jaw and front legs are missing; its eyes were probably once
                inlaid with glass. The statue is greater than life-size; it
                weighs six tonnes and measures 2.89 metres long and 1.82 metres
                high.In 2008, the Turkish town of Datça petitioned the British
                Ministry of Culture and Tourism for the return of the two
                statues known as the Lion of Knidos and the Demeter of Knidos.

                The first Western knowledge of the site was due to the mission
                of the Dilettante Society in 1812, and the excavations executed
                by C. T. Newton in 1857–1858.The agora, the theatre, an odeum, a
                temple of Dionysus, a temple of the Muses, a temple of Aphrodite
                and a great number of minor buildings have been identified, and
                the general plan of the city has been very clearly made out.

                Knidos is located around 110 kilometres from central Marmaris,
                although there is no direct public transport to Knidos from
                Marmaris. The easiest way is to rent a car and take a day trip
                to Knidos. Before you arrive the Datca junction on the
                Marmaris-Datca road, you will see the sign of Knidos which is on
                the far end of the peninsula.There are taxi boats and midi buses
                from Datca as well.
