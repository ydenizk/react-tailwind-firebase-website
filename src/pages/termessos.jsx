                Termessos was a Pisidian city built at an altitude of more than
                1000 metres at the south-west side of the mountain Solymos
                (modern-day Güllük Dağı) in the Taurus Mountains (modern-day
                Korkuteli). It lies 17 kilometres to the north-west of Antalya.
                It was founded on a natural platform on top of Güllük Dağı,
                soaring to a height of 1,665 metres from among the surrounding
                travertine mountains of Antalya.The hidden beauty Termessos is
                Concealed by pine forests and with a peaceful and untouched
                appearance, the site has a more distinct and impressive
                atmosphere than many other ancient cities.Termessos is one of
                the best preserved of the ancient cities of Turkey. The city was
                founded by the Solims, who were mentioned by Homer in the Iliad
                in connection with the legend of Bellerophon.
              </p>
              <p className="tracking-wider font-light  font-roboto  text-lg mb-6 leading-7 xs:text-base">
                From the main road, a steep road leads up to the city. From this
                road one can see the famous Yenice pass, through which wound the
                ancient road that the Termessians called "King Street" as well
                as Hellenistic period fortification walls, cisterns and many
                other remains. King Street, built in the 2nd century AD by
                contributions from the people of Termessos, passes through the
                city walls higher up and stretches in a straight line all the
                way to the centre of the city. In the walls to the east of the
                city gate are some extremely interesting inscriptions with
                augury by dice. Throughout the history of the Roman Empire,
                beliefs of this sort-in sorcery, magic, and superstition-were
                widespread. The Termessians were probably very interested in
                fortune telling. Inscriptions of this kind are usually four to
                five lines long and include numbers to be thrown with the dice,
                the name of the god wanted for soothsaying, and the nature of
                the prediction given in the counsels of that god.

                The city Termessians where the principal official buildings are
                located lies on a flat area a little beyond the inner walls.The
                most striking of these structures is the agora, which has very
                special architectural characteristics. The ground floor of this
                open-air market place has been raised on stone blocks, and to
                its north-west five big cisterns have been hollowed out.The
                agora is surrounded on three sides by stoas. According to the
                inscription found on the two-storey stoa on the north-west, it
                was presented to Termessos by Attalos II, king of Pergamum
                (reigned 150-138 BC) as proof of his friendship. The ruins lying
                to the north-east of the agora must belong to the gymnasium, but
                they are hard to make out among all the trees. The two-storey
                building consisted of an internal courtyard surrounded by
                vaulted rooms.

                To the east of the agora lies the theatre. Commanding a view out
                over the Pamphylian plain, this building is no doubt the most
                eyecatching in all the Termessos plain. It displays most clearly
                the features of the Roman theatre, which preserved the
                Hellenistic period theatre plan.The stage building exhibits
                features characteristic of the 2nd century AD. A long narrow
                room is all that lies behind it. This is connected with the
                podium where the play took place, by five doors piercing the
                richly ornamented facade or scaenae frons. Under the stage lie
                five small rooms where wild animals were kept before being taken
                into the orchestra for combat.The theater has 4,200 seats and
                shows the characteristics of a Roman theater, but has the semi
                circular design from Hellenist period.

                to the south, west and north of the city, mostly within the city
                walls, there are large cemeteries containing rock-cut tombs, one
                is supposed to have belonged to Alcetas himself who was one of
                Alexander the Great's commanders. He intended to take control of
                Termessos after Alexander's death.Unfortunately the tomb has
                been despoiled by treasure hunters. The sarcophagi, hidden for
                centuries among a dense growth of trees south-west of the city,
                transports one in an instant to the depths of history ceremony,
                the dead were placed in these sarcophagi along with their
                clothing, jewellery, and other rich accouterments. The bodies of
                the poor were buried in simple stone, clay, or wooden
                sarcophagi.In the Antalya Museum, there is a specific hall
                exhibiting the sarcophagi obtained from Termessos. Termessos,
                after a gradual decline, was finally abandoned in the 5th
                century. Some of the remains found there are the walls, the
                Hadrian's triumphal arch, the cisterns, the theater, the
                gymnasium, the agora, the odeon and the heroon. Among the tombs
                which are scattered far and wide can be seen those of Alcates,
                Agatemeros and the Lion decorated sarcophagi, which are
                extraordinary. No excavations have as yet been undertaken at
                Termessos.

                Visiting Termessos is a little more challenging than many of the
                other major sights in Turkey. This is due to its elevated
                position 1,000 metres above sea level and its location in the
                middle of the mountain range.Termessos is 25 km away from
                antalya city center and airport. You can take a taxi or rent a
                car from Antalya.Keep in mind that you should drive 8,5 km more
                to the parking area after you get in to the national park.Then
                you should also walk approx. 1.5 km to the top of the mountain
                where termessos stands from parking point.
