                Sagalassos is located in Ağlasun, Burdur Province, about 100 km
                north of Antalya.In Roman Imperial times, the town was known as
                the "first city of Pisidia", a region in the western Taurus
                mountains, currently known as the Turkish Lakes Region. During
                the Hellenistic period it was already one of the major Pisidian
                towns.

                The first traces of hunter/gatherers in the territory of
                Sagalassos date back to some 12 000 years BP.Under Phrygian and
                Lydian domination the site gradually developed into an urban
                centre. During the Persian period, Pisidia became known for its
                warlike and rebellious factions; a reputation to which the
                region certainly lived up in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great
                experienced fierce resistance at Sagalassos while conquering the
                region as part of his conquest of the Persian kingdom.isidia
                changed hands many times among the successors of Alexander.

              <p className="tracking-wider font-light  font-roboto  text-lg mb-6 leading-7">
                Rapidly, under Roman Imperial rule, Sagalassos became the
                metropolis of Pisidia. Trouble only started around 400 AD, when
                the town had to fortify its civic centre against, among others,
                rebellious Isaurian tribes. Sagalassos seems to have remained
                rather prosperous even under these conditions. After the
                earthquake around 500 AD, it was restored with a great sense of
                monumentality.As a result of recurring epidemics after the
                middle of the 6th century and related general decline of the
                economic system in Asia Minor, the city started to lose
                population. Large parts of the town were abandoned and the urban
                life was replaced by a more rural way of living.

              <p className="tracking-wider font-light  font-roboto  text-lg mb-5 leading-7">
                Sagalassos was destroyed in mid 13th century, by which time
                Seljuk's had already build a bath and a caravanserai in the
                village in the valley (Ağlasun). The abandoned ancient city was
                then rapidly covered under vegetation and erosion layers. As a
                result of its remote location, Sagalassos was not really looted
                in later periods and remained to be one of the best preserved
                ancient cities in the Mediterranean.

                The site of Sagalassos remains almost completely preserved, with
                the monumental structures, where in some cases almost all the
                original building stones can be recovered. It is an exceptional
                and unique case to find a middle sized but highly flourished
                town in such a well preserved state. An interdisciplinary
                archaeological research conducted on the site for the last
                nineteen years has documented all layers and kinds of
                occupation, delivering a coherent set of archaeological and
                environmental results that contribute to the history of the
                region. All these remains document at least a thousand years of
                continuous occupation (3rd century BC-13th century AD).

                In the following centuries, erosion covered the ruins of
                Sagalassos. It was not looted to a significant extent, possibly
                because of its location. Explorer Paul Lucas, who was traveling
                in Turkey on a mission , visited the ruins in 1706. After 1824,
                when Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell (1780–1846), the British
                chaplain at Smyrna and an antiquarian, visited the site and
                deciphered its name in inscriptions, Western travelers began to
                visit the ruins. Polish historian of art,K. Lanckoroński
                produced the first map of Sagalassos.
