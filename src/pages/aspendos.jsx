                Aspendos or Aspendus was an ancient Greco-Roman city in Antalya
                province of Turkey. The site is located 40 km east of the modern
                city of Antalya.In antiquity, Aspendos was probably the most
                important city in the state of Pamphylia. This glorious city
                came under Roman control in 190 BCE and reached its epoch during
                the Roman period, when trade and commerce flourished here.

                Aspendos did not play an important role in antiquity as a
                political force. Its political history during the colonisation
                period corresponded to the currents of the Pamphylian region.The
                Persians captured the city again in 411 BC and used it as a
                base. In 389 BC, Thrasybulus of Athens, in an effort to regain
                some of the prestige that city had lost in the Peloponnesian
                Wars.When Alexander the Great marched into Aspendos in 333 BC
                after capturing Perge, the citizens sent envoys asking him not
                to garrison soldiers there. He agreed, provided he would be
                given the taxes and horses that they had formerly paid as
                tribute to the Persian king.In 190 BC, the city surrendered to
                the Romans.

                Aspendos' theater is one of the largest ever built by the Romans
                in Asia Minor(Anatolia), and today it is one of the best
                preserved examples of Roman theater architecture.It was built in
                155[8] by the Greek architect Zenon, a native of the city,during
                Marcus Aurelius' reign. It was periodically repaired by the
                Seljuks, who used it as a caravanserai.As was usual to minimise
                construction complexity and cost, part of the theatre was built
                against the hill where the Citadel (Acropolis) stood, while the
                remainder was built on vaulted arches. The high stage, whose
                supporting columns are still in place,served to seemingly
                isolate the audience from the rest of the world. The new
                investigations have revealed that the capacity of the theatre
                was 7300-7600 people.The theatre hosts the annual Aspendos
                International Opera and Ballet Festival organized by Turkish
                State Opera and Ballet since 1994, with international
                participation of opera and ballet companies and an audience of
                about 10,000.

                Although mainly known for its theatre by the general public and
                visitors, Aspendos‟ aqueducts, with their two unique siphons,
                have been a source of extreme fascination for researchers.Just
                to the north of Aspendos' acropolis hill are the remains of a
                magnificent ancient aqueduct and two linked water towers, which
                would have originally provided water for the city.The aqueduct
                would have originally transported water for 19 kilometers and
                was built at some stage in the 3rd century CE.Nearby stand the
                remains of a stadium, baths, basilica, agora and nymphaeum. The
                Roman Eurymedon Bridge, reconstructed in the 13th century, is
                also in the vicinity.
