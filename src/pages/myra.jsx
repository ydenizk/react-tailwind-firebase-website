                Myra was a Lycian, then ancient Greek, then Greco-Roman, then
                Byzantine Greek, then Ottoman town in Lycia, which became the
                small Turkish town of Kale, renamed Demre in 2005, in the
                present-day Antalya Province of Turkey. In 1923, its Greek
                inhabitants had been required to leave by the Population
                exchange between Greece and Turkey, at which time its church was
                finally abandoned. Its early history is unknown. St. Paul is
                known to have visited the city, and in the 4th century St.
                Nicholas was its bishop. The Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius II
                made Myra the capital of Byzantine Lycia until the city fell to
                the caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd in 808 CE.

                The ancient Greek citizens worshiped Artemis Eleutheria, who was
                the protective goddess of the town. Zeus, Athena and Tyche were
                venerated as well. Pliny the Elder writes that in Myra there was
                the spring of Apollo called Curium and when summoned three times
                by the pipe the fishes come to give oracular responses.[ In the
                Roman period Myra formed a part of the Koine Greek speaking
                world that rapidly embraced Christianity. One of its early Greek
                bishops was Saint Nicholas.The earliest church of St. Nicholas
                at Myra was built by the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in the
                6th century. The present-day church was constructed mainly from
                the 8th century onward for the city's Byzantine Greek
                inhabitants; a Greek Orthodox monastery was added in the second
                half of the 11th century.The church is currently undergoing
                restoration. In 2007 the Turkish Ministry of Culture gave
                permission for the Divine Liturgy to be celebrated in the church
                for the first time in centuries.

                There are two necropoleis of Lycian rock-cut tombs in the form
                of temple fronts carved into the vertical faces of cliffs at
                Myra: the river necropolis and the ocean necropolis. The ocean
                necropolis is just northwest of the theatre. The best-known tomb
                in the river necropolis.

                After a siege in 809, Myra fell to Abbasid troops under Caliph
                Harun al-Rashid. Early in the reign of Alexius I Comnenus (ruled
                between 1081 and 1118), Myra was again overtaken by Islamic
                invaders, this time the Seljuk Turks. In the confusion, sailors
                from Bari in Italy seized the relics of Saint Nicholas, over the
                objections of the monks caring for them, and spirited the
                remains away to Bari, where they arrived on May 9, 1087, and
                soon brought that city visitors making pilgrimage to Saint
                Nicholas.

                Archaeologists first detected the ancient city in 2009 using
                ground-penetrating radar that revealed anomalies whose shape and
                size suggested walls and buildings. Over the next two years they
                excavated a small, stunning 13th-century chapel sealed in an
                uncanny state of preservation. Carved out of one wall is a cross
                that, when sunlit, beams its shape onto the altar
