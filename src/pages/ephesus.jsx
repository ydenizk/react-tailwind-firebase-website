                These traditional pastoralists come from hundreds of miles away.
                They congregate on a dusty plain outside the town, where they
                sip masala tea around the campfire and smoke the conical clay
                pipe known as a chillum. In their white tunics, leather
                slippers, and jeweled earrings, they cut striking figures, never
                moreso than when they let their luxurious mustaches run through
                their fingers. More than mere styling, their colorful turbans
                communicate caste and native region.

                Sadly, it is getting harder for these tribesmen to do business.
                Camel trading has declined in recent years; whereas 30,000
                animals might have changed hands at Pushkar in decades past,
                5,000 is the present norm. Moreover, the majority of camels at
                Pushkar are now sold for meat, a transaction that herdsmen would
                have once considered disgraceful. But with pastureland getting
                scarce and their profession waning in prestige, they have little
                choice.
